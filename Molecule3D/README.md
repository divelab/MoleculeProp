# Molecule3D: A Benchmark for Predicting 3D Geometries from Molecular Graphs
In this module, we provide software tools for processing our proposed Molecule3D dataset and codes to reproduce the baseline results. The goal of this module is to provide a benchmark for ground-state geometry prediction. Our paper is available [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=m5rEiGxOGiL).

## Download Dataset
Please download the raw data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1y-EyoDYMvWZwClc2uvXrM4_hQBtM85BI?usp=sharing). Then, put it in your data folder.

## Environment setup

* If you use CUDA 11.0, you can easily setup the environment using the provided yaml file. Please make sure [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is installed firstly. Then you can execute the following commands one by one to install and activate the environment.
```linux
conda env create -f mol3d.yaml
source activate pred3d  (or conda activate pred3d)
pip install torch-scatter==latest+cu110 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
pip install torch-sparse==latest+cu110 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
pip install torch-cluster==latest+cu110 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
pip install torch-spline-conv==latest+cu110 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0.html
pip install torch-geometric
```

* If you use other CUDA version, you can setup the environment manually. The key packages we used are listed as follows. Note that the versions of PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric should be compatible, and they both need to be compatible with your CUDA version.
    - scipy
    - IPython
    - tqdm
    - rdkit-pypi
    - pandas
    - [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    - [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

After setting up the environment, you can install the moleculex package by the following command:

```
pip install moleculex==0.0.3
```

## Running Baseline Methods

Download the code and go to the Molecule3D directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/divelab/MoleculeX
cd Molecule3D
```

## Develop your own models

Create your workspace following the directory tree shown in Download Dataset.
Follow build_yours.ipynb as an example to develop your own models. 

### Geometry Prediction
You can run pred3d_dist.py to train a model for ground-state geometry prediction. Before running, please specify the path to save the checkpoints and other outputs in conf['out_path'], and whether using random or scaffold split in conf['split']. Then, execute the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${your_gpu_id} python pred3d_dist.py
```

### Property Prediction
You can run pred_prop_3d.py to train a model for property prediction with geometries. Before running, please specify the path to save the checkpoints and other outputs in conf['out_path'], and whether using random or scaffold split in conf['split']. In addition, you need to specify the type of geometry to be used in conf['geoinput']. Use 'pred' for the predicted geometry, 'gt' for the ground-truth geometry, and 'rdkit' for the geometry generated by RDKit. If you are using the predicted geometry, you also need to specify the path to the saved geometry prediction checkpoints in conf['geo_model_path']. Besides, you can specify the property to be predicted by setting the target id number in conf['target'] according to the following table.

| Target ID Number | Property |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| 0 | Dipole x |
| 1 | Dipole y |
| 2 | Dipole z |
| 3 | HOMO |
| 4 | LUMO |
| 5 | HOMO-LUMO Gap |
| 6 | SCF Energy |

Then, execute the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${your_gpu_id} python pred_prop_3d.py
```

You can run pred_prop_2d.py to train a model for property prediction with only molecular graphs. Before running, please specify the path to save the checkpoints and other outputs in conf['out_path'], and whether using random or scaffold split in conf['split']. Similarly, specify the target id number according to the above table. Then, execute the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${your_gpu_id} python pred_prop_2d.py
```
